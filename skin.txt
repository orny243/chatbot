Anti-aging creams are predominantly moisturizer-based skin care products marketed with unproven claims of making the consumer look younger by reducing, masking or preventing signs of skin aging. Anti-aging supplements are ingestible products promoted to diminish the effects of aging, including vitamin supplements, powders, and teas.[1]
In the United States, anti-aging products are commonly marketed with false health claims, and are deemed to be among various scams on consumers.[2][3] Since 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued dozens of warning letters to manufacturers of skin care products with false marketing – including supposed anti-aging effects – about the benefits of such products, which are not authorized to be marketed as drugs that would require FDA approval to be safe and effective for treating the aging process.[3][4]

Anti-aging cream. The manufacturer of these products received an FDA warning letter in February 2015 for falsely advertising its cosmetics products as drugs.[4]
Traditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are common in the 21st century.[5] Marketing of anti-aging products has been criticized as reinforcing ageism, particularly against women.[6] Anti-aging promotions specifically reinforce the belief that older people should look like middle-aged people, and that old age comes with a loss of gender identity.[7]
